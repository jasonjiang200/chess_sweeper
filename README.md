# chess_sweeper
Play the combination of chess and minesweeper!

To play, download the files and run __init__.py. 
Once a game is started, use chess notation to click a square. An empty square will be marked with its number, and a square with a hidden piece will be marked by an exclamation point. To flag a square, type the piece's chess symbol (K, N, P, R, Q, B) after the square. For example, g3 uncovers the square, and g3r marks it with a rook.
You have a certain number of lives to uncover all squares and label all pieces correctly.
